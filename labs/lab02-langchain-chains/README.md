# Lab 02: LangChain Chains and Prompts

## Learning Objectives
- Master sequential and parallel chains
- Create complex prompt templates
- Use chain routing and conditional logic
- Implement retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- Work with different chain types

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Lab 01
- Understanding of basic LangChain concepts

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will:
1. Build sequential chains
2. Create router chains
3. Implement RAG with document retrieval
4. Use different chain patterns
5. Build a complete Q&A system

## Tasks

### Task 1: Sequential Chains
Create a chain that processes data through multiple steps.

### Task 2: Router Chains
Build a chain that routes to different sub-chains based on input.

### Task 3: RAG Implementation
Implement a simple retrieval-augmented generation system.

### Task 4: Conversation Chains
Create a chain that maintains context across multiple exchanges.

### Task 5: Complete Application
Build a document Q&A system using all learned concepts.

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand advanced chain patterns
- Implement complex workflows
- Work with document retrieval
- Build production-ready applications

## Resources
- [LangChain Chains](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/)
- [RAG Tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)

## Next Steps
Proceed to **Lab 03: LangChain Agents** to learn about autonomous agents.
