# TODO: Task 1 - Define State Schema
# Create a TypedDict class that represents the graph state
# Include fields like: messages, step, user_input, result


# TODO: Task 2 - Create Nodes
# Define functions that will serve as graph nodes
# Each function should receive state and return updated state


# TODO: Task 3 - Build the Graph
# Import StateGraph from langgraph.graph
# Create a graph with your state schema
# Add nodes and edges


# TODO: Task 4 - Add Conditional Logic
# Implement a function that determines the next node based on state
# Add conditional edges to your graph


# TODO: Task 5 - Compile and Run
# Compile the graph
# Run it with test input
