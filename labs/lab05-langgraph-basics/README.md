# Lab 05: LangGraph Basics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand LangGraph architecture
- Create state graphs with nodes and edges
- Implement conditional routing
- Build cyclic workflows
- Manage state across graph execution

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Labs 01-04
- Understanding of LangChain concepts
- Familiarity with state management

## Lab Overview
In this lab, you will:
1. Create a simple state graph
2. Add nodes with processing logic
3. Implement conditional edges
4. Build a cyclic workflow
5. Create a multi-step agent

## Tasks

### Task 1: Define State Schema
Create a typed state dictionary for the graph.

### Task 2: Create Nodes
Build processing nodes that modify state.

### Task 3: Add Edges
Connect nodes with regular and conditional edges.

### Task 4: Build Cyclic Graph
Implement a graph with loops for iterative processing.

### Task 5: Complete Agent
Create a complete agent that iterates until a goal is met.

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand graph-based workflows
- Implement stateful applications
- Use conditional logic in graphs
- Build iterative processes

## Resources
- [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)
- [State Management Guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/)

## Next Steps
Proceed to **Lab 06: LangGraph Stateful Applications** for advanced patterns.
